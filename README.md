## required modules:

* start from main.py run
	> python main.py [arguments]
		
	  train_model - type if you wants to train model before model inference
	
	  dflt / None - it loads existing model for model inference

* while giving path as input always give directory path without file name
* while performing image processing always give path to the single image or path of directoy where you have two folder named as "Train" and "Validation"
* path for data images if you wants to retrain model: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y6mw98eAQLHaEiYNme97PbW5LNb0CXxm?usp=sharing
